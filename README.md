Hello.
A little about me.
I like anything thats computer related. All of it is so intresting and sometimes complicated. I've always been intrested in learning how things work and the complexity of computers is fascinating. I still get surprised when I think about the people who created this stuff. They were real geniuses.
I like programming in my spare time to practice and so that I never forget all of the things I learn.
